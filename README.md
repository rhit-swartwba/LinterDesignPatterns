## Configure and Run Tests ##
Upon running the main method, a JFileChooser will appear. Then you can navigate through the file chooser to find any .class files you wish to use. In order to test the tests that we have provided,
You can navigate to where ever you IDE projects are strored and within this project look for the "target" folder which has all the .class files for the tests in the "test-classes" folder. You can select 
mulitple files from the JFileChooser by ctrl or shift clicking multiple files. Once you choose the files, you can select which tests you would like to run in the next popup box. Once you select the tests,
they will run and the results will be printed out to the console.
